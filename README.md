Flight test


I just want to share a Power BI project to reflect how I managed, cleaned and processed the data.

All the data came from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/ and some of it was modified because it was a test for a company.

The test reflect those questions:
Load the 3 files into Power BI. Make sure you transform the data where necessary. Duplicate values in dimension tables may be present.
Create a Calendar table in Power BI for 2015 January.
Create the relationships between the dimension tables and the ‘flights’ fact table.
Add a slicer that will allow us to filter by date.
Create the following visualizations and calculate the necessary measures:
A bar chart that shows the average arrival delay time by airline (flights arriving before on schedule should be filtered out)
i. Color the bar chart’s columns with gradient coloring

Add 2 card visualizations: Add the Airlines with the lowest average in delay time and the highest average in delay time. Make sure the cards have a title, too.
Create a stacked bar chart that shows the number of delayed landings and non-delayed landings by [airport]
Filter this visual so that we only see the top 10 airports with the most landings in total.
Create a card which shows the percentage of all delayed, and all on or before schedule landings.
Filter out all ‘cancelled’ or ‘diverted’ flights from the whole page.
